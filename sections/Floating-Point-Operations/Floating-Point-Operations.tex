A \CL{} implementation or a \CL{} library implementing this
specification will provide the following \emph{non-computational
  operations} (to follow the language of Section~5 of \cite{2008:IEEE-754})
alongside some \CL{} features to allow for read-time (cfr.,
\emph{translation-time}) evaluations.

\undecided{Conformance}{Much of the content of
  Section~\ref{sect:fp-environment-queries} is still ia a state of flux.}
