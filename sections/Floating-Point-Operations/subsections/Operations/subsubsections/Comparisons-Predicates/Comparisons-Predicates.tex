  % The dyadic version of \code{=} performs an arthimetic equality test
  % between \varname{a} and \varname{b}.  The monadic and n-adic versions are built upon

  % It is assumed that \varname{a} and \varname{b} are converted (as per
  % the \emph{contagion rules} of \CL{}) to be of the same type.
  % Therefore the following cases can be be considered as per the LIA
  % specifications.
  
  % \begin{description}
  % \item If \varname{a} and \varname{b} are either finite integers, finite
  % floating point numbers, or finite complex numbers then the result is
  % \varname{true} if the two numbers are equal in the mathematical sense.  In the
  % LIA spec this is the result of $\mathit{eq}_T(a, b) \equiv a = b$ for an
  % appropriate $T$.  This is the standard \CL{} case.
  
  % \item If \varname {a} and \varname {b} are \clieeeterm{infinities} then
  % \code{=} returns \varname{true} if they are both positive or both
  % negative; otherwise it returns \varname{false}.
  
  % \item If either \varname {a} or \varname {b} is a \clieeeterm{quiet NaN},
  % and, respectively, \varname {b} and \varname {a} is not a
  % \clieeeterm{signaling NaN}, then the result is \varname{false}.
  
  % \item Complex numbers are checked recursively on the real and imaginary
  % parts.

  % \DExceptional{}
  
  % If either \varname {a} or \varname {b} is a \clieeeterm{signaling
