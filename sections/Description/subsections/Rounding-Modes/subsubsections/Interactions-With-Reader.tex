\begin{document}

The \CL{} reader builds floating point numbers according to the rules
specified in \cite{1994:ANSICL}.  This specification states that the
\CL{} reader subsystem is not affected by changes of the rounding
mode.  That is,
\begin{alltt}
CL prompt> \codeprompt{(round-upward (read))}
42.0
\textit{42.0}
\end{alltt}
will produce a \code{42.0} result that is rounded according to the
standard rules of the \CL{} reader floating point parsing
rules, overriding the \code{round-upward} settings.

\cllianote{Minimization of required changes.}{The spec tries to
  minimize the changes that an implementation must introduce; hence
  the choice -- for the time being -- not to require changes to the
  reader; an implementation of \code{PARSE-FLOAT} could explored
  before requiring changes to the \CL{} reader.}
