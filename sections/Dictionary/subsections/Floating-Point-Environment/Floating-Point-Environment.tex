The \CLang{} specification \cite{2018:C18}, Section~7.6, defines the \emph{Floating
  Point Environment} for a \CLang{} implementation.  Various \CL{}
implementations provide access to the floating point environment, but
with a wide range of interfaces, which boils down tho the assumed
representation of the \CLang{} \code{fenv\_t} type, described in
\cite{2018:C18}.

This specification describes an interface which should accommodate the
current -- at the tie of this writing -- treatment of the floating
point environment provided by various \CL{} implementations.
